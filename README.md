## Smart Home Automation - HomeIQ
Welcome to HomeIQ – a smart home automation app built with Flutter ⚡.
This project is the companion to my YouTube series "Home Automation App in Flutter", where I design and build a complete IoT-based home automation system.

 With this app, I can control and monitor smart plugs and devices installed across different rooms — turning them on/off, adjusting light intensity, and creating a seamless connected experience.

🔧 What you’ll find in this project

📦 Hardware Selection & Setup – the products I used, their specs, and installation process.

💻 Flutter Development – building a cross-platform solution that works on Android, iOS, and tablets.

🌐 IoT Integration – sending real-time commands to devices and syncing states.

🏠 Multi-Device Deployment – any device around the house can act as a hub to manage room-specific appliances.

This project combines hardware + software + design to create a truly smart living experience.
